### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Welinton Diniz, from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I am currently unemployed, but in my spare time I help to [ONG Projeto Emanuel](https://www.instagram.com/projetoemanuel1). I am in a serious relationship with JavaScript (ðŸ’™), especially React and React Native!

Would you like to meet me?
